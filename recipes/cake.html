  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li>Add the eggs, buttermilk, oil, and vanilla. Beat until the mixture is smooth.</li>
    <li>Stir in the boiling water by hand. The batter will be thin, but this is normal.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
    <li>Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Allow to cool for 10 minutes in the pans, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    <li>Once cooled, frost with your choice of chocolate frosting and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
